# Kickstarting-Analysis-Challenge-1

## Overview of Project:

Louise is planning to start a campaign for a play. Louise is using information from previous plays that caught her interest in different parts of the world, focusing on Great Britain and United States. Data is taken from different categories to determine if the play would be successful and profitable. In the data successful, live , failed and canceled plays in theaters will be used to answer questions for Louise. 

### Purpose

Louise wants to have a successful play, so before she plans and execute Louise has some concerns. Before she starts to campaign for the play, Louise is asking for help to prevent her from failing and losing profit. Louise is asking to use specific information to determine the best time of year, month and place to have a successful campaign in order for her to have a successful and profitable play. The information will be retrieved from numerous plays from the past and present.  

## Analysis and Challenges

To prepare any analysis many challenges can and did occur. Manipulating information in the workbook was difficult at times. Many manipulations were used such as IFERROR which was used to correct the ROUND formulas when #DIV! where presented. Manipulation information when the cells are empty or have 0 is were solved by debugging.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date:

Conclusion:

Based on the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Dates it can be giving a fact that in July a lot of theater plays were canceled. Live theater were only launched from January through March. In February through April had a low number of failed plays in theaters. The chart also gives a true statement that in the month of May it was a very profitable months for the theaters.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Conclusion:

Based on the Outcome Based Goals, the successful percentage started at a high percentage between 70%- 80% for the plays that was than with a 1000 goal. With the goal of 25000 the percentage is still in the range of 70% â€“ 80 %. The failed percentage was at the highest percentage of 90% with the goal 40000 to 44999. The lowest failed percentage is between 20%-30% of less than 1000. The goal of 5000 to 4999 the failed and successful plays balanced out at 50%. The canceled plays stayed at 0%.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered:

The most difficult and challenging of this project was vlookup and remembering to filter the columns to get the correct results. 

## Results

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Based on the Outcome Based on Goals chart show that with a goal of 25000 is most likely that a play will succeed amongst other factors that can be taken in account. A goal of 5000 will give a play 50% chance of success. When the goal is in the high range it has a 90% chance of failure. Canceled plays stayed at a 0% at all goal levels. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The dataset presented some limitations of having the specific information needed that required to be filtered in order to compile right data to answer a specific question to help the analysis results. Interpreting/formatting information to the correct number formula(i.e. percentage, accounting and dates).Having zero in a cell that may not be seen in the top of the data report but could probably pose a issue when calculating formulas. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

In the world of graphs and tables, we could have used pie charts, scatter plot, and area charts. Pie chart could have been used to show results of the Outcomes Based on Goals data. Scatter plot charts could have been useful with the Parent outcome chart for theaters. Area chart could have been used for the Outcomes Based on Launch Date data. Other charts and graphs can be used as well but these particular charts that was named was picked based on the data in the Kickstart Analysis.
